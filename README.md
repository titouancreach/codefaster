# Code faster

Dactylo test are based on words or sentences but never on code. A programmer spends its time to type symbols. 
Code faster is a dactlylo test using your own code.

# Usage

`python3 ./codefaster.py base_directory`

# Misc

Codefaster doesn't need any additional library to work. But you can install `termcolor` to have a colored output.
